# Currency App Dagger
This is an example of Android application using TDD and MVP design pattern to show the current Currency information.
It is written 100% in Kotlin with both Espresso and Unit tests.

This demo explains below concepts such as:

1. TDD architecture
2. MVP design pattern
3. Dagger dependency injection
4. Kotlin code architecture
5. ReactiveX for Async operations
6. Clean code concept

Features:

Neat build.gradle with shared dependencies.

Dagger2 with android component. Injectable Views and structure to make the app testable and maintanable.

State management with RxKotlin and Android Components - background-foreground and orientation changes will connect to the ongoing network request.

Network requests continue in the background - UI is capable of retrieval of the current state when resumed.

Custom retrofit call factory to handle no connection error in a reactive way.

Espresso tests with overriden dependencies and MockWebServer.

Easy debuggable builds.
